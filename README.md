Diego Bernaschina's artwork Â© 2019

Only the sample of the web art (net.art) for the exhibition of the New Biennial of Digital Art "The Wrong" of 2019-2020

DESCRIPTION:

This is a series of animated GIF images aiming to transform exhibition spaces through image manipulation and Net.art practices. This work has been developed with the help of research on the study of colors and digital effects. The GIFs form part of communicative practice - in social networks and online spaces - considering the role of cyberculture/cyberspace in new aesthetic awareness. In this way, media art can play a fundamental role in education for viewers and users to explore, experiment and express themselves.
